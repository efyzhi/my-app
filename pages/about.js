        <p>  Hi there, I am Sunday Robert.
  I have always love to be part of who makes the internet breath by contributing to it not only via usage. But then I thought it's only for geniuses not until I built a project using HTML and CSS.
  
  Then I gain confidence that I can do this, and now within the space of 1 year, I can write in Javascript and it's library (REACT and VUE)
  
  I'm currently looking for an entry level position or internship. </p>
      </>
