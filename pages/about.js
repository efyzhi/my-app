  I have always love to be part of who makes the internet breath by contributing to it not only via usage. But then I thought it's only for geniuses not until I built a project using HTML and CSS.
  
  Then I gain confidence that I can do this, and now within the space of 1 year, I can write in Javascript and it's library (REACT and VUE)
  
  I'm currently looking for an entry level position or internship, so as to imporve my skills and become better at building functionally aesthetic websites and also to impart others with knowledge. </p>
